- Basically you have two choices - either using or not using OpenGL. The first approach requires you to use QGLWidget and to display images by binding them as textures (using bindTexture()) and using those textures on a rectangle (preferably square one) which you display in the GL widget. With the other approach you will be displaying images on a QLabel object using QLabel::setPixmap(). The GL approach will be much faster but requires more coding.

- See why the sudden drop in FPS once the camera stream kicks in, regardless of whether we're processing images or not.

- Optimize image processing.
